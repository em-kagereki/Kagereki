### Project Description: Expert-augmented network analysis to for drug repurposing in bile tract cancer. 

Project repository:  <a href="https://github.com/em-kagereki/Graph-analysis">em-kagereki/Graph-analysis </a> 

**Project description:** Bile tract cancer is a cluster of highly heterogeneous & aggressive malignant tumour that can arise at any point of the biliary tree. Different anatomical sites and genetic aberrations contribute to this heterogeneity.These  BTC sub types have different prognosis and response to therapy.
<br>
This analysis sought to identify the crucial genes in BTC and thereafter identify potential linkages with  site specific  chemotherapeutic compounds.

### RPerio: A collection of tools for Case Definitions and prevalences in Population-Based Surveillance of Periodontitis. 

Project repository:  <a href="https://github.com/em-kagereki/RPerio">em-kagereki/RPerio </a> 

Tools for Case Definitions and prevalences in Population-Based Surveillance of Periodontitis A collection of tools for Case Definitions and prevalences in Population-Based Surveillance of Periodontitis. The functionality is experimental and functions are likely to changein the future. This is based on the fact that periodontal case definitions is a rapidly changing ares. The functions hereby are based on the CDC Working Group (2010), as well as the 5thEuropean workshop in Periodontology case definitions. However, if you come acroos ideas interesting we would be very interested in a discussion of this proposal. Contributions are more than welcome!



#Bile tract cancer

### 1. Suggest hypotheses about the causes of observed phenomena

```

### 2. Assess assumptions on which statistical inference will be based

```javascript
if (isAwesome){
  return true
}
```

### 3. Support the selection of appropriate statistical tools and techniques
