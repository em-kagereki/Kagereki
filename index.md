## Welcome

---

I am an data scientist who firmly believes that the advancement of technology for the betterment of humanity depends on principles of digital transformation. Often when I think about digital transformations, the Myth of Sisyphus comes to mind.

The Myth of concerns the king of Corinth, punished in Hades for his misdeeds by eternally having to roll a heavy stone up a hill: every time he approached the top, the stone escaped his grasp and rolled to the bottom

Developing technology based solution can easily turn into a Sisyphean task - once you think you have it all figured out, everything falls down into pieces!

I am passionate to engage in processes that lead to value discovery with a transformation agenda. I have hands on experience in identifying and planning for the future state of enterprise technology environments while incorporating new solutions that create a strategic advantage and expanded business growth.

That said I am a life-long learner and energized by solving new problems and transforming how our clients think.
